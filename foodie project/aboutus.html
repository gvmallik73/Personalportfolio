A thali is usually accompanied by small round bowls called katoris, though there are also thalis made with built-in compartments for different dishes, much like a bento box.

In his book “The Story of Our Food,” K. T. Achaya writes that in prehistoric India, food was eaten on disposable plates made of leaves, such as a large banana leaf, stitched-together dried banyan leaves, or leaves from palas trees. Even the katoris were made of leaves.<br><br><b>A thali consists of:<br><br><b>
a grain: rice or flatbread made with wheat, millet, etc.<br>
lentils: dal or sambar<br>
vegetables: a seasonal preparation<br>
chutney: a condiment made with fruit, herbs, spices, and even vegetables and fish<br>
raita: curds usually mixed with some kind of vegetable<br>
pickles: most commonly made from raw mango, though that varies by region<br>
papadum: a deep-fried, savory snack made with rice, flour, or lentils<br>
This is followed by buttermilk or sol kadi, a refreshing drink made with coconut milk and kokum fruit, if you’re on the western coast of India.<br></p>
